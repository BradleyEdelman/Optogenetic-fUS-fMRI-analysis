- Demonstrates the integration of **functional ultrasound (fUS) and functional MRI (fMRI)** during optogenetic stimulations in anesethetized mice.  
- **Key findings:**
  - Showed **circuit-specific optogenetic activation patterns** across the brain.
  - Revealed that fUS is a more sensitive readout thatn fMRI of optogenetically-induced brain activity under similar conditions
  - Found a vessel type-specific effect on hemodynamic responses to neural activation
